# WalzPSIIProcessing
A pipeline to process multiframe tifs exported from ImagingWin .pim files

You will need to export your .pim files to multiframe .tifs and then drop them in /data/raw_multiframe
They should be labeled with exactly 2 underscores, 2 descriptors, and a date: e.g. experiment1_20190501_drought.tif
